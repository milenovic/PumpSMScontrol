# PumpSMScontrol
This is a very dirty code for controling and monitoring the pressure of an industrial pump based on Cinterion Siemens TC65i Java GSM Module.

It is an old project of mine, therefore it is written in mixed Serbian/English, and would require a nice cleanup. Nevertheless, the system is operating in the field since August 2012!
